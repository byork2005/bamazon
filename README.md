# bamazon
node app using mySQL database


/* psuedocode
finish adding in last function to add new product. It would have been an Insert Into command.
Need to fix the add inventory fn. I think it's a scope issue with too many connection queries.
Get the cli-table npm to work. I spent too much time trying to get it to work properly initially.
That would have finished to 2nd part of the assignment.

3rd part. add new table to bamazon db. Just use the same syntax as before with new columns.
